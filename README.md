* `DigitalOcean` - hosting

## Installation

### Frontend

* install packages:

```shell
yarn install
```

* add environment variables to `.env` file in project root:

```txt
#.env
REACT_APP_MNIST_URL=<backend_url>/v1/predict/mnist
```

* run app for development:

```shell
yarn start
```

* build app for production in `build` folder:

```shell
yarn build
```

### Backend

* install packages:

```shell

```

## Deployment

### Frontend

The frontend application is running at [www.mlmodels.org](https://www.mlmodels.org). It is deployed via GitHub through Netlify.

### Backend
